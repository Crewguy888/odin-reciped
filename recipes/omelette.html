    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. 
            Cook the portobello mushroom and red onion in the olive oil until 
            the mushroom has softened, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg whites and water together in a small bowl; pour over the mushroom and onion mixture. 
            Season the egg whites with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the egg whites are no longer runny, about 5 minutes.
             Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the mixture; top with the pesto. Fold the omelette in half and continue cooking until the cheese melts, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
